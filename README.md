# Hotel-Cancellation-ML-k-NN
The objective of this project was to find factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, and then build a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance. I received an overall prediction accuracy of 81% on my test data set after using k-NN, which was a 5% improvement from the initial logistic regression model. The key factors that influenced cancellation the most were booking online, guests not selecting a meal plan, and booking weekend night stays.
